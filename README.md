# README: Financial Loans Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project analyzes financial loan data to gain insights into loan distribution, approval trends, interest rates, default rates, borrower characteristics, and loan performance.The first worksheet contains the data in its raw form and the subsequent worksheets are of the work done on them. The analysis is performed using Microsoft Excel, employing various data processing and visualization techniques. The results are compiled into pivot tables, pivot charts, a dashboard, and a regression model to extract meaningful trends.

## Background

Understanding loan distribution and borrower behavior is crucial for financial institutions to assess risk and improve lending decisions. This project explores loan data to provide insights into key financial indicators such as interest rates, debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, loan approval trends, and default rates. By leveraging Excel's analytical tools, this study offers data-driven conclusions that help interpret financial loan performance.

## Tools and Techniques Used

The following tools and techniques were used for data analysis:

- **Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts**: Used to summarize and visualize loan data from different perspectives.
- **Dashboard**: An interactive dashboard was created to consolidate key insights.
- **Regression Analysis**: Performed to examine relationships between loan payments and loan amounts.
- **Data Cleaning Techniques**:
  - Standardization of data, including converting interest rates and DTI to percentages.
  - Formatting dates to ensure uniformity.
- **Excel, Git, and GitHub**: The project files, including pivot tables, pivot charts, and dashboard, are stored in a GitHub repository for version control and sharing.

## Data Analysis

The analysis was conducted using eight pivot tables and corresponding pivot charts, with findings summarized below:

### 1. Loan Distribution by Grade

- This pivot table categorizes loans based on their grade (A, B, C, etc.).
- The pivot chart visualizes the distribution of loans across different grades.
- **What I Learned:** Higher-grade loans generally have lower interest rates, while lower-grade loans tend to have higher default rates.

### 2. Loan Approval Trends Over Time

- This pivot table tracks loan approvals over different periods.
- The pivot chart shows fluctuations in approvals over time.
- **What I Learned:** Loan approvals have seasonal trends, with certain periods experiencing higher approvals, possibly due to economic conditions.

### 3. Average Interest Rate

- The pivot table calculates the average interest rate for different loan categories.
- The pivot chart displays variations in interest rates across loan types.
- **What I Learned:** Interest rates vary significantly based on borrower profiles and loan grades.

### 4. Loan Default Rate

- This pivot table analyzes the percentage of loans that default.
- The pivot chart visualizes default trends.
- **What I Learned:** Higher-risk loan categories show a higher default rate, emphasizing the need for better risk assessment models.

### 5. Borrower Analysis

- This pivot table categorizes borrowers based on key attributes such as income, employment status, and credit score.
- The pivot chart highlights patterns in borrower characteristics.
- **What I Learned:** Income level and credit score are strong indicators of loan approval likelihood.

### 6. Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio vs. Loan Amount

- This pivot table explores the relationship between DTI ratio and loan amounts.
- The pivot chart visualizes how debt levels impact borrowing capacity.
- **What I Learned:** Higher DTI ratios may limit the loan amount borrowers qualify for, reinforcing the importance of financial stability.

### 7. Loans by Verification Status

- This pivot table examines the proportion of verified vs. unverified loans.
- The pivot chart compares approval rates based on verification status.
- **What I Learned:** Verified borrowers tend to receive larger loans with lower interest rates, indicating that verification plays a role in risk assessment.

### 8. Loan Performance by State

- This pivot table categorizes loan performance across different states.
- The pivot chart maps variations in loan approval and default rates by region.
- **What I Learned:** Certain states have higher default rates, possibly due to regional economic conditions or lending practices.

## Summary Statistics
The worksheet labelled summary statistics contains summary data on loan amounts, interest rates and debt to income ration including but not limited to the average, maximum, minimum and counting high and low risk dti.

## Dashboard

A dashboard consolidates key insights from the pivot tables and charts, allowing for an interactive overview of loan trends and borrower characteristics. This is an interactive dashboard which includes slicers connected to the whole dashboard to allow users to check how different components of financial loans have an impact on each other.

## Regression Analysis

A regression model was conducted to analyze the relationship between loan amounts and loan payment. The findings provide insights into the factors influencing loan performance. The conclusion was that there is a negative correlation between loan amounts and loan payments.

## Repository Information

All pivot charts are available in the project's repository on GitHub for further review and exploration. Please check the Excel workbook in the repository for first-hand information on the aforementioned pivot tables and the dashboard.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into loan distribution, borrower behavior, and risk assessment. The analysis highlighted key factors influencing loan approvals, interest rates, and default rates. By applying data analysis techniques in Excel, we gained a deeper understanding of financial lending trends and borrower dynamics.
